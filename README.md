# Docker Practice Repository

This repository contains files and projects uploaded during my Docker practice sessions. These files represent various hands-on projects and exercises to help me better understand Docker concepts, including containerization, multi-container setups, and other related practices.

## Contents

- **projects/**  
    This folder contains the following subprojects:
    - **flask-app-ecs**: A simple Flask application running on ECS.
    - **simple-java-docker**: A basic Docker setup for a Java application.
    - **two-tier-flask-app**: A Flask-based application with a multi-tier setup using Docker.

These files and projects were part of my ongoing learning experience with Docker. The practice covers concepts such as creating Dockerfiles, managing images, running containers, and more.

## Purpose

The purpose of these files is to:
- Demonstrate various Docker workflows
- Serve as a reference for Docker practices in real-world applications
- Continuously improve my skills in Docker and containerization
